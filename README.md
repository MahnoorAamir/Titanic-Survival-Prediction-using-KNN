# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

## üìå Project Objective

The objective of this project is to predict whether passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on various features like age, class, gender, and more. This end-to-end machine learning pipeline includes:

- Data loading and exploration
- Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Data visualization
- Model building using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluation of model performance



## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
